<p class="topspacing1">A few years ago a little
inconsequent volume was
launched on partial acquaintance,
telling of some
ordinary books which line our friendly
shelves, of some kindly friends who
had read and chatted about them, some
old stories they had told, and some
happy memories they had awakened.</p>

<p>When those acquaintances had read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the little book, they asked, like Oliver,
for more. A rash request, because, unlike
Oliver, they get it in the shape
of another "Olla Podrida" of book-chat,
picture-gossip, and perchance a
stray "chestnut." Their good-nature
must be invoked to receive it, like
C. S. Calverley's sojourners&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Since</span>
we made our last
"Tour Round the Book-shelves,"
death has removed one of the kindest
friends, and most genial companions, of
the Book-room. In Richard Corney
Grain, Foxwold has lost one of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
pleasantest and most welcome guests,
and it is doubtful, well as the public
cared for and appreciated his genius, if
it knew or suspected how generous a
heart, and how wide a charity, moved
beneath that massive frame. When
rare half-holidays came, it was no uncommon
thing for Dick Grain to dedicate
them to the solace and amusement
of some hospital or children's home,
where, with a small cottage piano, he
would, moving from ward to ward,
give the suffering patients an hour's
freedom from their pain, and some
happy laughs amid their misery.</p>

<p>One day, after a series of short performances
in the different parts of one
of our large London hospitals, he was
about to sing in the accident ward,
when the secretary to the hospital
gravely asked him "Not to be too
funny in this room, for fear he'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
make the patients burst their bandages!"</p>

<p>Dick Grain was never so happy, so
natural, or so amusing as when, of his
own motion, he was singing to a nursery
full of children in a country
house.</p>

<p>Those who knew him well were aware
that, delightful as were all his humorous
impersonations, he had a graver and
more impressive side to his lovable and
admirable character, and that he would
sometimes, when sure he would be
understood, sing a pathetic song, which
made the tears flow as rapidly as in
others the smiles had been evoked.</p>

<p>Who that heard it will forget his
little French song, supposed to be
sung by one of the first Napoleon's

why St. George's Hall? Why not go at

Plays at night. Entertainments in the afternoon.
Besides, we are so empty in the

so on, every quarter of an hour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A Picture</span>
hangs at Foxwold
of supreme interest
and beauty, being a portrait
of General Wolfe by Gainsborough.
Its history is shortly this&mdash;painted
in Bath in 1758, probably for
Miss Lowther, to whom he was then
engaged, and whose miniature he was
wearing when death claimed him; it
afterwards became the property of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Gibbons, a picture collector, who lived
in the Regent's Park in London, descending
in due course to his son, whose
widow eventually sold it to Thomas
Woolner, the R.A. and sculptor; it
was bought for Foxwold from Mrs.
Woolner in 1895.</p>

<p>The great master has most wonderfully
rendered the hero's long, gaunt,
sallow face lit up by fine sad eyes full
of coming sorrow and present ill-health.
His cocked hat and red coat slashed
with silver braid are brilliantly painted,
whilst his red hair is discreetly subdued
by a touch of powder.</p>

<p>One especial interest that attends this
picture in its present home is, that
within two miles of Foxwold he was
born, and passed some youthful years in
the picturesque little town of Westerham,
his birthplace, and that his short
and wonderful career will always be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
especially connected with Squerryes
Court, then the property of his friend
George Warde, and still in the possession
of that family.</p>

<p>Until recently no adequate or satisfactory
life of Wolfe existed, but Mr.
A. G. Bradley has now filled the gap
with his beautiful and affecting monograph
for the Macmillan Series of
English Men of Action: a little book
which should be read by every English
boy who desires to know by what
means this happy land is what it is.</p>

<p>In country houses the best decoration
is portraits, portraits, and always portraits.
In the town by all means show
fine landscape and sea-scape&mdash;heathery
hills and blue seas&mdash;fisher folks and
plough boys&mdash;but when from your
windows the happy autumn fields and
glowing woods are seen, let the eye
returning to the homely walls be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
cheered with the answer of face to face,
human interests and human features
leading the memory into historic channels
and memory's brightest corners.
How pleasant it is in the room where,
in the spirit, we now meet, to chat beneath
the brilliant eyes of R. B. Sheridan,
limned by Sir Joshua, or to note
with a smile the dignified importance
of Fuseli, painted by Harlow, or to
turn to the last portrait of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, painted by himself, and of
which picture Mr. Ruskin once remarked,
"How deaf he has drawn
himself."</p>

<p>Of the fashion in particular painters'
works, Christie's rooms give a most
instructive object-lesson. It is within
the writer's memory when Romneys
could be bought for £20 apiece, and
now that they are fetching thousands,
the wise will turn to some other master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
at present neglected, and gather for
his store pictures quite as full of beauty
and truth, and whose price will not
cause his heirs to blaspheme.</p>

<p>A constant watchful attendance at
Christie's is in itself a liberal education,
and it seldom happens that those who
know cannot during its pleasant season
find "that grain of gold" which is
often hidden away in a mass of mediocrity.
And then those clever, courteous
members of the great house are always
ready to give the modest inquirer the
full benefit of their vast knowledge,
and, if necessary, will turn to their
priceless records, and guide the timid,
if appreciative, visitor into the right
path of selection.</p>

<p>What a delightful thing it is to be
present at a field-day in King Street.
The early lunch at the club&mdash;the settling
into a backed-chair at the exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
proper angle to the rostrum and the
picture-stand. (The rostrum, by the
way, was made by Chippendale for the
founder of the house.) At one o'clock
the great Mr. Woods winds his way
through the expectant throng, and is
promptly shut into his pulpit, the steps
of which are as promptly tucked in and
the business and pleasure of the afternoon
begins. Mr. Woods, dominating
his audience</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2_6">Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>gives a quick glance round the big
room, now filled with well-known
faces, whose nod to the auctioneer is
often priceless. Sir William Agnew
rubs shoulders with Lord Rosebery, and
Sir T. C. Robinson whispers his doubts
of a picture to a Trustee of the National
Collection; old Mr. Vokins extols, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
you care to listen, the old English
water-colourists, to many of whom he
was a good friend, and Mr. George
Redford makes some notes of the best
pictures for the Press; but Mr. Woods'
quiet incisive voice demands silence as
Lot 1 is offered with little prefix, and
soon finds a buyer at a moderate price.</p>

<p>The catalogues, which read so pleasantly
and convey so much within a
little space, are models of clever composition,
beginning with items of lesser
interest and carefully leading up to the
great attractions of the afternoon, which
fall to the bid of thousands of guineas
from some great picture-buyer, amidst
the applause of the general crowd.</p>

<p>A pure Romney, a winsome Gainsborough,
a golden Turner, or a Corot
full of mystery and beauty, will often
evoke a round of hand-clapping when
it appears upon the selling-easel, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
swift and sharp contest between two
or three well-known connoisseurs will
excite the audience like a horse-race, a
fencing bout, or a stage drama.</p>

<p>The history of Christie's is yet to
be written, notwithstanding Mr. Redford's
admirable work on "Art Sales,"
and when it is written it should be one
of the most fascinating histories of the
nineteenth century; but where is the
Horace Walpole to indite such a
work? and who possesses the necessary
materials?</p>

<p>One curious little history I can tell
concerning a sale in recent years of the
Z&mdash;&mdash; collection of pictures and <i>objets
d'art</i>, which will, to those who know it
not, prove "a strange story."</p>

<p>A former owner, distinguished by
his social qualities and position, in a
fit of passion unfortunately killed his
footman. The wretched victim had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
friends, and was therefore not missed,
and the only person, besides his slayer,
aware of his death, and how it was
caused, was the butler. The crime
was therefore successfully concealed, and
no inquiries made. But after a little
time the butler began to use his knowledge
for his own personal purposes.</p>

<p>Putting the pressure of the blackmailer
upon his unhappy master, he
began to make him sing, by receiving
as the price of his silence, first a fine
picture or two, then some rare china,
followed by art furniture, busts, more
pictures, and more china, until he had
well-nigh stripped the house.</p>

<p>Still, like the daughter of the horse-leech,
crying, "Give, give!" he made
his nominal master assign to him the
entire estates, reserving only to himself
a life interest, which, in his miserable
state of bondage, did not last long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief butler on his master's
death took his name and possessions,
ousting the rightful heirs; and after
enjoying a wicked, but not uncommon,
prosperity with his stolen goods for
some years, he also died in the odour
of sanctity, and went to his own place.</p>

<p>His successors, hearing uneasy rumours,
determined to be rid of their tainted
inheritance; so placed all the pictures
and pretty things in the sale-market,
and otherwise disposed of their ill-gotten
property.</p>

best holiday for an
over-worked man, who has
little time to spare, and
who has not given "hostages
to fortune," is to sail across the
herring-pond on a Cunarder or White
Star hotel, and so get free from newspapers,
letters, visitors, dinner-parties,
and all the daily irritations of modern
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Those grand Atlantic rollers fill the
veins with new life, the tired brain
with fresh ideas; and the happy, idle
days slip away all too soon, after which
a short stay in New York or Boston
City, and then back again.</p>

<p>The study of character on board is
always pleasant and instructive, and
sometimes a happy friendship is begun
which lasts beyond the voyage.</p>

<p>Then, again, the cliques into which
the passengers so naturally fall, is funny
to watch. The reading set, who early
and late occupy the best placed chairs,
and wade through a vast mass of miscellaneous
literature, and are only roused
therefrom by the ringing summons to
meals; then there is the betting and
gambling set, who fill card and smoking
room as long as the rules permit, coming
to the surface now and then for breath,
and to see what the day's run has been,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
or to organise fresh sweepstakes; then
there is often an evangelical set, who
gather in a ring upon the deck, if permitted,
and sing hymns, and address in
fervid tones the sinners around them;
then there are the gossips (most pleasant
folk these), the flirts, the deck pedestrians,
those who dress three times a
day, and those who dress hardly at all:
and so the drama of a little world is
played before a very appreciative little
audience.</p>

<p>I remember on such a journey being
greatly interested in the study of a
delightful rugged old Scotch engineer,
whose friendship I obtained by a genuine
admiration for his devotion to his
engines, and his belief in their personality.
It was his habit in the evening,
after a long day's run, to sit alongside
these throbbing monsters and play his
violin to them, upon which he was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
very fair performer, saying, "They deserved
cheering up a bit after such a
hard day's work!" This was a real and
serious sentiment on his part, and inspired
respect and an amused admiration
on ours.</p>

<p>The humours of one particular voyage
which I have in my memory, were
delightfully intensified by the presence
on board of a very charming American
child, called Flossie L&mdash;&mdash;, about fourteen
years old, who by her capital
repartees, acute observation, and pretty
face, kept her particular set of friends
very much alive, and made all who
knew her, her devoted slaves and
admirers.</p>

<p>Her remark upon a preternaturally
grave person, who marched the deck
each day before our chairs, "that she
guessed he had a lot of laughter coiled
up in him somewhere," proved, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the voyage was over, to be quite
true.</p>

<p>It was this gentleman who, one
morning, solemnly confided to a friend
that he was a little suspicious of the
drains on board!</p>

<p>Americanisms, which are now every
one's property, were at this time&mdash;I am
speaking of twenty years ago&mdash;not so
common, and glided from Flossie's
pretty lips most enchantingly. To be
told on a wet morning, with half a gale
of wind blowing, "to put on a skin-coat
and gum-boots" to meet the elements,
was at that day startling, if useful,
advice. She professed a serious attachment
for a New York cousin, aged
sixteen, "Because," she said, "he is
so dissolute, plays cards, smokes cigars,
reads novels, and runs away when
offered candy." Her quieter moments on
deck were passed in reading 'Dombey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and Son,' which, when finished, she
pronounced to be all wrong, "only one
really nice man in the book&mdash;Carker&mdash;and
he ought to have married Floey."</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh Childers, then First Lord
of the Admiralty, was a passenger on
board our boat, and having with infinite
kindness and patience explained to the
child our daily progress with a big
chart spread on the deck and coloured
pins, was somewhat startled to see her
execute a <i>pas seul</i> over his precious
map and disappear down the nearest
gangway, with the remark, "My sakes,
Mr. Childers, how terribly frivolous
you are!"</p>

<p>She had a youthful brother on board,
who, one day at dinner, astonished his
table by coolly saying, as he pointed
to a most inoffensive old lady dining
opposite to him, "Steward, take away
that woman, she makes me sick!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>A stout and amiable friend of
Flossie's, who shall be nameless in
these blameless records, on coming in
sight of land assumed, and I fear did it
very badly, some emotion at the first
sight of her great country, only to be
crushed by her immediate order, given
in the sight and hearing of some hundred
delighted passengers, "Sailor, give
this trembling elephant an arm, I guess
he's going to be sick!" Luckily for
him the voyage was practically over,
but for its small remnant he was known
to every one on board as the trembling
elephant.</p>

<p>One day a pleasant little American
neighbour at dinner touched one's
sense of humour by naïvely saying,
"If you don't remove that nasty little
boiled hen in front of you, I know I
must be ill."</p>

<p>Then there was a dull and solemn prig
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
on board, who at every meal gave us,
unasked, and <i>apropos des bottes</i>, some
tremendous facts and statistics to digest,
such as the number of shrimps eaten
each year in London, or how many
miles of iron tubing go to make the
Saltash bridge. Finding one morning
on his deck-chair, just vacated, a copy
of Whitaker's Almanack and a volume
of Mayhew's "London Labour and
the London Poor," we recognised the
source of his elucidations, and promptly
consigned his precious books to a
watery grave. Of that voyage, so far as
he was concerned, the rest was silence.</p>

<p>Upon remarking to an American on
board that the gentleman in question
was rather slow, he brought down a
Nasmyth hammer with which to crack
his nut by saying, "Slow, sir; yes, he's
a big bit slower than the hour hand of
eternity!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember on another pleasant
voyage to Boston meeting and forming
lasting friendship with the late Judge
Abbott of that city, whose stories and
conversation were alike delightful. He
spoke of a rival barrister, who once
before the law courts, on opening his
speech for the defence of some notorious
prisoner, said, "Gentlemen, I shall
divide my address to you into three
parts, and in the first I shall confine
myself to the <i>Facts</i> of this case;
secondly, I shall endeavour to explain
the <i>Law</i> of this case; and finally, I
shall make an all-fired rush at your
passions!"</p>

<p>It was Judge Abbott who told me
that when at the Bar he defended, and
successfully, a young man charged with
forging and uttering bank-notes for
large values. After going fully into the
case, he was entirely convinced of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
client's innocence, an impression with
which he succeeded in imbuing the
court. After his acquittal, his client, to
mark his extreme sense of gratitude to
his counsel's ability, insisted upon paying
him double fees. The judge's
pleasure at this compliment became
modified, when it soon after proved
that the said fees were remitted in
notes undoubtedly forged, and for the
making of which he had just been
tried and found "not guilty!"</p>

<p>Speaking one day of the general
ignorance of the people one met, he
very aptly quoted one of Beecher
Ward's witty aphorisms, "That it is
wonderful how much knowledge some
people manage to steer clear of."
Another quotation of his from the same
ample source, I remember especially
pleased me. Speaking of the morbid
manner in which many dwelt persistently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
on the more sorrowful incidents
and accidents of their lives, he said,
"Don't nurse your sorrows on your
knee, but spank them and put them
to bed!"</p>

<p>On one visit to the States I took a letter
of special commendation to the worthy
landlord of the Parker House Hotel
in Boston. On arriving I delivered my
missive at the bar, was told the good
gentleman was out, was duly allotted
excellent rooms, and later on sat down
with an English travelling companion
to an equally excellent dinner in the
ladies' saloon. In the middle of our
repast we saw a small Jewish-looking
man wending his way between the
many tables in, what is literally, the
marble hall, towards us. Standing
beside our table, and regarding us with
the benignant expression of an archbishop,
he carefully, though unasked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
filled and emptied a bumper of our
well-iced Pommery Greno, saying,
"Now, gentlemen, don't rise, but my
name's Parker!"</p>

<p>Upon a first visit to America few
things are more striking than the originality
and vigour of some of the advertisements.
One advocating the use of
some hair-wash or cream pleased us
greatly by the simple reason it gave for
its purchase, "that it was both elegant
and chaste." Another huge placard
represented our Queen Victoria arrayed
in crown, robes, and sceptre, drinking
old Jacob Townsend's Sarsaparilla out
of a pewter pint-pot. I also saw a
most elaborate allegorical design with
life-size figures, purporting to induce
you to buy and try somebody's tobacco.
I remember that a tall Yankee, supposed
to represent Passion, was smoking
the said tobacco in a very fiery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
aggressive manner, that with one hand
he was binding Youth and Folly
together with chains, presumably for
refusing him a light, whilst with the
other he chucked Vice under the chin,
she having apparently been more amenable
and polite.</p>

<p>To note how customs change, I one
day in New York entered a car in the
Broadway, taking the last vacant seat.
A few minutes, and we stopped again
to admit a stout negress laden with her
market purchases. The car was hot,
and I was glad to yield her my seat, and
stand on the cooler outside platform.
She took it with a wide grin, saying
with a dramatic wave of her dusky
paw, "You, sir, am a gentleman, de
rest am 'ogs!" a speech which would
not so many years ago have probably
cost her her life at the next lamppost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>A Washington doctor once told me
the following little story, which seems
to hold a peculiar humour of its own.
A country lad and lassie, promised
lovers, are in New York for a day's
holiday. He takes her into one of those
sugar-candy, preserved fruit, ice, and
pastry shops which abound, and asks
her tenderly what she'll have? She
thinks she'll try a brandied peach. The
waiter places a large glass cylinder
holding perhaps a couple of dozen of
them on their table, so that they may
help themselves. These peaches, be it
known, are preserved in a spirituous
syrup, with the whole kernels interspersed,
and are very expensive. To
the horror of the young man, the girl
just steadily worked her way through
the whole bottleful. Having accomplished
this feat without turning a
hair, she pauses, when the lover, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
delicate would-be sarcastic note, asks
with effusion, if she won't try another
peach? To which the girl coyly
answers, "No thank you, I don't like
them, the seeds scratch my throat!"</p>

<p>As is well known, most of the waiters
and servants in American hotels are Irish.
Dining with a dear old Canadian friend
at the Windsor Hotel in New York,
we were particularly amused by the
quaint look and speech of the Irish
gentleman who condescended to bring
us our dinner. He had a face like an
unpeeled kidney potato, with twinkling
merry little blue eyes. Not feeling
well, I had prescribed for myself a
water diet during the meal, and hoped
my guest would atone for my shortcomings
with the wine. After he had
twice helped himself to champagne,
the while I modestly sipped my seltzer,
my waiter's indignation at what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
supposed was nothing less than base
treachery, found vent in the following
stage-aside to me: "Hev an oi,
sorr, on your frind, he's a-gaining
on ye!"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Armed</span>
with a special order
of the then Lord Mayor, Sir
Robert Nicholas Fowler,
I sallied forth one lovely
blue day in June, and timidly rang the
little brass bell beside the little green
door giving into Newgate Prison.</p>

<p>The gaol is now only used to house
the prisoners on the days of trial, and
for executions on the days of expiation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
at other times, save for the presence of
a couple of warders, it is entirely empty,
and empty it was on this my day of call.</p>

<p>Presenting my mandate to the very
civil warder who replied to my summons,
I was (he having to guard the
door) handed to his colleague's care,
to be shown the mysteries of this great
silent tomb, lying so gloomily amid the
City's stir.</p>

<p>The first point of interest was the
chapel, with that terribly suggestive
chair, standing alone in the centre of
the floor opposite the pulpit, on which
the condemned used to sit the Sunday
before his dreadful death, and, the observed
of all the other prisoners, heard
his own funeral sermon preached&mdash;a
refinement of cruelty difficult to understand
in this very Christian country.
Then followed a visit to the condemned
cells, two in number, and which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
situated far below the level of the outside
street. They are small square
rooms with whitewashed walls, enlivened
by one or two peculiarly ill-chosen
texts; in each is a fixed truckle
bedstead, with a warder's fixed seat on
either side. The warder in attendance
stated that he had passed many nights
in them with condemned prisoners, and
had rarely found his charges either restless
or unable to sleep well, long, and
calmly!</p>

<p>There is an old story told of a murderer,
about whose case some doubt was
raised, and to whom the prison chaplain,
as he lay under sentence of death,
lent a Bible. In due course a free
pardon arrived, and as the prisoner left
the gaol, he turned to the chaplain
saying, "Well, sir, here's your Bible;
many thanks for the loan of it, and I
only hope I shall never want it again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we visited the pinioning room;
this process is carried out by strapping
on a sort of leather strait-waistcoat,
with buckles at the back and outside
sockets for the arms and wrists. While
putting on one of these, I found the
leather was cold and damp; it then
occurred to me, with some horror, that
it was still moist with the death-sweat
of the executed.</p>

<p>The scaffold stands alone across one
of the yards, in a little wooden building
not inappropriately like a butcher's
shop. When used, the large shutter
in front is let down, and the interior is
seen to consist of a heavy cross-beam
on two uprights, a link or two of chain
in the middle, a very deep drop, with
padded leather sides to deaden the
sound of the falling platform, a covered
space on one side for the coffin, and on
the other a strong lever, such as is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
used on railways to move the points,
and which here draws the bolt, releasing
the platform on which the culprit
stands; a high stool for the victim,
should he prove nervous or faint&mdash;and
that is all the furniture and fittings of
this gruesome building.</p>

<p>The dark cell is perhaps the most
dreadful part of this peculiarly ghastly
show, and after being shut in it for a
few minutes, which seemed hours, one
fully understood its terrific taming
power over the most rebellious prisoners:
you are literally enveloped in a sort of
velvety blackness that can be felt,
which, with the absolute and awful
silence, seemed to force the blood to
the head and choke one.</p>

<p>Upon asking the warder to tell us
something of the idiosyncrasies of the
more celebrated criminals he had known,
he stated that Wainright the murderer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
was the most talkative, vain, and boastful
person he had seen there, that his
craving for tobacco was curiously extreme,
and he was immensely gratified
when the governor of the prison promised
him a large cigar the night before
his execution. The promise kept, he
walked up and down the yard with
the governor, detailing with unctuous
pleasure his youthful amours and deceptions,
like another Pepys. "But,"
added my informant, "the pleasantest,
cheeriest man we ever had to hang in
my time was Dr. Lampson, full of fun
and anecdote, with nice manners that
made him friends all round. He was
outwardly very brave in facing his fate,
and yet, as he walked to the scaffold,
those behind him saw all the back
muscles writhing, working, and twitching
like snakes in a bag, and thus
belying the calm face and gentle smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in front. Ah! we missed him very
much indeed, and were very sorry to
lose him. A real gentleman he was
in every way!"</p>

<p>It was pleasant, and a vast relief after
this strange experience, to emerge suddenly
from this dream of mad, sad, bad
things into the roar of the City streets,
to see the blue sky, and find men's faces
looking once again pleasantly into our
own; but, nevertheless, Newgate should
be seen by the curious, and those who
can do so without coercion, before it
disappears.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>
is the present fashion to
extol the old bookbinders
at the expense of the
living, and for collectors
to give fabulous prices for a volume
bound by De Thou, Geoffroy Tory,
Philippe le Noir, the two Eves (Nicolas
and Clovis), Le Gascon, Derome, and
others.</p>

<p>Beautiful, rare, and interesting as their
work is, I venture to say that we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
modern bookbinders in England and
France who can, and do, if you give
them plenty of time and a free hand
as to price, produce work as fine, as
original, as closely thought out, as
beautiful in design, material, and colour,
as that of any of the great masters of
the craft of olden days.</p>

<p>For perfectly simple work of the best
kind, examine the bindings of the late
Francis Bedford; and his name reminds
me of a curious freak of the late Duke
of Portland in relation to this art. He
subscribed for all the ordinary newspapers
and magazines of the day, and
instead of consigning them to the waste-paper
basket when read, had them whole
bound in beautiful crushed morocco
coats of many colours by the said Bedford;
then he had perfectly fitting oaken
boxes made, lined with white velvet, and
fitted with a patent Bramah lock and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
duplicate keys, each box to hold one
volume, the total cost of thus habiting
this literary rubbish being about £40
a volume. Bedford kept a special staff
of expert workmen upon this curious
standing order until the Duke died. By
his will he, unfortunately, made them
heirlooms, otherwise they would have
sold well as curiosities, many bibliophiles
liking to have possessed a volume
with so odd a history. Soon after the
Duke's death I went over the well-known
house in Cavendish Square with
my kind friend Mr. Woods of King
Street, and he showed me piles of these
boxes, each containing its beautifully
bound volume of uselessness.</p>

<p>But to return to our sheepskins. I
would ask, where can you see finer
workmanship than Mr. Joseph W.
Zaehnsdorf puts into his enchanting
covers? He once produced two lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
pieces of softly tanned, vellum-like
leather of the purest white colour, and
asked if I knew what they were. After
some ineffectual guesses, he stated that
the one with the somewhat coarser texture
was a man's skin, and the finer
specimen a woman's. The idea was
disagreeable, and I declined to purchase
or to have any volumes belonging to my
simple shelves clothed in such garments.</p>

<p>An English bookbinder who made
a name in his day was Hayday; he
flourished (as the biographical dictionaries
are fond of saying) in the beginning
of the present reign. I possess
Samuel Rogers' "Poems" and "Italy,"
in two quarto volumes, bound by him
very charmingly. In this size Turner's
drawings, which illustrate these two
books, are shown to admiration, and
alone galvanise these otherwise dreary
works. Hayday was succeeded by one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Mansell, who also did some good work;
but I think domestic affliction beclouded
his later years, and affected his business,
as I have lost sight of him for some
years.</p>

<p>Among other English bookbinders
of the present day I would name Tout,
whose simple, Quaker-like work, with
Grolier tooling, is worth seeing. Mackenzie
was, in his day, a good old
Scotch binder; but the treasure I have
personally found and introduced to
many, is my excellent friend Mr. Birdsall
of Northampton. His specialty is
supposed to be in vellum bindings, which
material he manipulates with a grace
and finish very satisfactory to see. He
can make the hinges of a vellum-bound
book swing as easily as a friend's door.
He spares no time, thought, or trouble
in working out suitable designs for the
books entrusted to his care. For instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
I possess Benjamin D'Israeli's
German Grammar, used by him when
a boy, and to bind it as he felt it deserved,
he specially cast a brass stamp,
with D'Israeli's crest, which, impressed
adown the back and on the panels, correctly
finishes this interesting memento.
Then, again, when he had Beau Brummell's
"Life" to work upon, he used
dies representing a poppy, as an emblem
flower, a money-bag, very empty, and
a teasel, signifying the hanger-on: these
show thought, as well as a pleasant
fancy, and greatly add to the interest
of the completed binding.</p>

<p>I have some work by M. Marius
Michel, the great French binder, whose
show-cases in the Faubourg-Saint-Germain,
in Paris, were a treat to examine.
He was kind enough to let me one
fine day select and take therefrom two
volumes of E. A. Poe's works translated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and noted by Beaudelaire, beautifully
clothed by him; and he, at the same
visit, gave me an autograph copy of
his "L'Ornamentation des Reliures
Modernes," with which, when I returned
to England, I asked Mr. Birdsall to do
what he could. Set a binder to catch
a binder, was in this case our motto,
and Mr. Birdsall has, I think, fairly
caught out his great rival, although I
have not yet had an opportunity of
taking M. Michel's opinion upon the
Englishman's work.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>One of the leading characteristics of
the present day is its craze for work,
unceasing work, work early and late,
work done with a rush, destroying
nerves, and rendering repose impossible.
"Late taking rest and eating the bread of
carefulness" do not go together, the bread
being as a rule anything but carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
consumed. R. L. Stevenson somewhere
says, "So long as you are a bit of a
coward, and inflexible in money matters,
you fulfil the whole duty of man," and
perhaps this is the creed of the present
race of over-workers. In the City of
London we see this hasting to be rich
brought to the perfection of a Fine Art
(with a capital F and a capital A).</p>

<p>Charles Dickens, who always resolved
the wit of every question into a nutshell,
makes Eugene Wrayburn, in
"Our Mutual Friend," strenuously
object to being always urged forward
in the path of energy.</p>

<p>"There's nothing like work," said
Mr. Boffin; "look at the bees!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," returned
Eugene, with a reluctant smile, "but
will you excuse my mentioning that I
always protest against being referred to
the bees? ... I object on principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as a two-footed creature, to being constantly
referred to insects and four-footed
creatures. I object to being required
to model my proceedings according to
the proceedings of the bee, or the dog,
or the spider, or the camel. I fully
admit that the camel, for instance, is
an excessively temperate person; but
he has several stomachs to entertain
himself with, and I have only one."...</p>

<p>"But," urged Mr. Boffin, "I said the
bee, they work."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Eugene disparagingly,
"they work, but don't you think they
overdo it? They work so much more
than they need&mdash;they make so much
more than they can eat&mdash;they are so
incessantly boring and buzzing at their
one idea till Death comes upon them&mdash;that
don't you think they overdo it?"</p>

<p>Some time since I cut from the pages
of the <i>St. James' Gazette</i> the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
"Cynical Song of the City," which
pleasantly sets forth the present craze
for work, and again proves, like Dickens'
bee, that we rather overdo it:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Guests at Foxwold are given the opportunity,
when black Monday arrives,
of catching a most unearthly and uneasily
early train, which involves their
rising with anything but a lark, swallowing
a hurried breakfast, a mounting
into fiery untamed one-horse shays soon
after eight, and then being puffed away
through South-Eastern tunnels to the
busy hum of those unduly busy men of
whom we speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>To catch this early train, which
means that you "leave the warm precincts
of your cheerful bed, nor cast one
longing lingering look behind," some
of our friends most justly object, preferring
the early calm, the well-considered
uprisal, the dawdled breakfast,
and the ladies' train at the maturer hour
of 10.30. Our dear friend, Mr. Anstey
Guthrie, having firmly and most wisely
declined the early train and any consequent
worm, one very chilly morn, as
the early risers were starting for the
station, appeared at his chamber window
awfully arrayed in white, and muttering
with the fervour of another John
Bradford, "There goes Anstey Guthrie&mdash;but
for the grace of God," plunged
back into his rapidly cooling couch,
"and left the world to darkness and
to us."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">My</span>
good and kind old friend
Robert Baxter, who now
rests from his labours, was,
during his long active life
in Westminster (dispensing law to the
rich and sharing its profits with the
poor), one of the most charitable and
hospitable of men.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, even his goodness
was taxed with such severity, as to
somewhat try his patience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The once well-known Mrs. X&mdash;&mdash;
of A&mdash;&mdash;, a philanthropic but foolish
old woman, arrived late one evening, uninvited,
at his house in Queen's Square,
suffering from the first symptoms of
rheumatic fever. Calmly establishing
herself in the best guest-chamber, and
surrounded by the necessary maid,
nurse, and doctor, she turned her kind
host's dwelling into a private hospital
for many weeks. When at last she
reached the stage of convalescence, and
was allowed to take daily outings and
airings, Mr. Baxter's capital old butler,
Sage, had the privilege of carrying the
fair but weighty invalid downstairs to
the carriage, and upstairs to her rooms
once, and often twice, a day. No
small effort for any man's strength,
however athletic he might be, and
Sage, be it conceded, was a moderate
giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The weeks dragged themselves away,
and at last the welcome date for a final
flitting to her own home arrived. Sage
felt that he had well earned an extraordinary
douceur for all his labours,
and was not therefore surprised when
the good lady on leaving slipped into
his willing hand a suggestive looking
folded-up blue slip of paper instead of
the more limited gold. Retiring to
his pantry to satisfy his very natural
curiosity as to the amount of the vail
so fully deserved, his feelings may be
imagined, but not described, when he
found that instead of the expected
cheque, it was what, in evangelical
circles, is called a leaflet, bearing on
its face the following appropriate and
cheerful text: "Thou fool! this night
thy soul shall be required of thee!"</p>

<p>Whilst upon the subject of misapplied
texts, another instance, touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
with a pleasant humour, occurs to me.
Many years ago I visited for the first
time an old friend and his wife in their
pleasant country house. Upon being
shown into what was evidently one of
the best guest-chambers, I was intensely
delighted to find over the mantelpiece
the following framed text, in large
illuminated letters: "Occupy till I
come!" Unprepared to make so long
a stay, I left on the Monday morning
following, and have no doubt the generous
invitation still remains to welcome
the coming guest.</p>

<p>Another story of a like nature was
told us by Mr. Anstey Guthrie, and is
therefore worth repeating. He once
saw a long procession of happy school-children
going to some feast, headed
by a band of music and a standard-bearer.
The latter was staggering beneath
an immense banner, on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was painted the Lion of Saint Mark's,
rampant, with mouth, teeth, and claws
ready and rapacious; underneath was
the singularly appropriate and happy
legend, "Suffer little children to come
unto Me."</p>

<p>Another capital story from the same
source, which time cannot wither, nor
custom stale, is, that at some small
English seaside resort a spirited and
generous townsman has presented a
number of free seats for the parade,
each one adorned with an iron label
stating that "Mr. Jones of this town
presented these free seats for the public's
use, the sea is his, and he made it."</p>

in some eyes, have importance, but time
has sobered his more erratic flights,
leaving a large residuum of fine work,
both in poetry and prose, which would
make him a worthy successor to any
of those gone before.</p>

<p>Of the smaller fry, it is difficult to
prophesy which will hereafter come
to the front, and what of their work
may live.</p>

<p>The late Lord Lytton (Owen Meredith)
was very unequal in all he produced.
Perhaps the following ballad
from his volume of "Selected Poems,"
published in 1894 by Longmans, is one
of the best and most characteristic he
has written:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Edmund Gosse's work is always
scholarly and well thought out, framed
in easy, pleasant English. In some of
his poems he reminds one of the
"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table."

<p>A few fortunate persons possess copies
of Mr. Gosse's catalogue of his library,
and it is, I rejoice to say, on the Foxwold
shelves. It is a most charming
work, reflecting on every page, by many
subtle touches, the refined humour and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
wide knowledge of the collector. Mr.
Austin Dobson wrote for the final fly-leaf
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the little mutual admiration and

<div class="topspacing1">
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_086b.jpg" alt="Letter W"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Within</span>
the past year certain
gentle disputes and friendly
discussions as to the origin
of <i>Punch</i>, and who its
first real editor was, and whether or no
Henry Mayhew evolved it with the
help of suitable friends in a debtor's
prison, remind us that Foxwold possesses
some rather curious "memories" of this
famous paper.</p>

<p>These disputes should now be put
to rest for ever by Mr. Spielmann's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
exhaustive "History of Mr. Punch,"
which, it may safely be supposed, appeared
with some sort of authority from
"Mr. Punch" himself.</p>

<p>One of our "Odds and Ends" is a
kit-kat portrait in oil of Horace Mayhew,
"Ponny," excellent both as a
likeness and a work of art, which
should eventually find hanging space
in the celebrated <i>Punch</i> dining-room.
There is also a pencil drawing of him,
in which "the Count," as he was called,
is dressed in the smartest fashion of that
day, and crowned with a D'Orsay hat,
resplendent, original, and gay.</p>

<p>He made a rather unhappy marriage
late in his life, and found that habits
from which he was not personally free
showed themselves rather frequently in
his wife's conduct. One day, in a state
of emotion and whisky and water, he
pressed Mark Lemon's hand, and, bursting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
into tears, murmured, "My dear friend,
she drinks! she drinks!!" "All
right," was the editor's cheery reply,
"my dear boy; cheer up, so do you!"</p>

<p>Near by hangs a characteristic pencil
sketch of Douglas Jerrold, who, if small,
was no hunchback (as has been lately
stated), but was a very neatly made,
active little man, with a grand head
covered with a profusion of lightish
hair, which he had a trick of throwing
back, like a lion's mane, and a pair of
bright piercing blue eyes. There is an
engraving of a bust of him prefixed to
his life (written by his son, Blanchard
Jerrold), which well conveys the nobility
of the well-set head. Then comes a
capital drawing of Kenny Meadows in
profile, and a thoroughly characteristic
Irish phiz it is.</p>

<p>These pencil portraits are all from
the gifted hand of Mr. George Augustus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Sala, and formerly belonged to Horace
Mayhew himself. Mr. Sala, as is now
well known by means of his autobiography,
was once an artist and book-illustrator,
and Foxwold is the proud
possessor of the only picture in oil
extant from his brush. It is called
"Saturday Night in a Gin-Palace":
it is full of a Hogarthian power, and
by its execution, drawing, and colour
shows that had Mr. Sala made painting
his profession instead of literature, he
would have gone far and fared well.
The little picture is signed "G. A.
Sala," and was found many years ago in
an old house in Brompton, when the
present owner secured it for a moderate
sum, and then wrote to Mr. Sala asking
if the picture was authentic. A reply
was received by the next post, in the
beautiful handwriting for which he is
famous, and runs as follows:&mdash;-</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
  <div class="margin-left-25 smcap"><span class="smcap">46 Mecklenburgh Square, W.C.</span>,</div>
  <div class="right"><i>Tuesday, Twenty-fifth June 1878</i>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>I beg to acknowledge receipt of
your courteous and (to me) singularly interesting
note.</p>

<p>"Yes, the little old oil-picture of the
'Gin-Palace Bar' is mine sure enough. I
can remember it as distinctly as though it
had been painted yesterday. Great casks of
liquor in the background; little stunted
figures (including one of a dustman with a
shovel) in the foreground. Details executed
with laborious niggling minuteness; but the
whole work must be now dingy and faded
to almost total obscuration, since I remember
that in painting it I only used turpentine for
a medium, the spirit of which must have
long since 'flown,' and left the pigment flat
or 'scaly.'</p>

<p>"The thing was done in Paris six-and-twenty
years ago (Ap. 1852), and being
brought to London, was sold to the late
Adolphus Ackermann, of the bygone art-publishing
firm of Ackermann &amp; Co., 96
Strand (premises now occupied by E.
Rimmel, the perfumer), for the sum of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
pounds. I hope that you did not give more
than a few shillings for it, for it was a vile
little daub. I was at the time when I produced
it an engraver and lithographer, and
I believe that Mr. Ackermann only purchased
the picture with a view to encourage me to
'take up' oil-painting. But I did not do so.
I 'took up' literature instead, and a pretty
market I have brought my pigs to! At all
events, <i>you</i> possess the only picture in oil
extant from the brush of</p>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">George Augustus Sala</span>."</div>
<p><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">H. N. Pym</span>, Esq.</p>
</div>

<p class="topspacing1">When Mr. Sala afterwards called to
see the picture, he altered his mind as
to its being "a vile little daub," and
found the colours as fresh and bright as
when painted. We greatly value it, if
only as the cause of a lasting friendship
it started with the artist.</p>

<p>His own portrait by Vernet, in pen
and ink, now graces our little gallery;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it is a back view, taken amidst his
books, and a most characteristic and
excellent likeness of this accomplished
and versatile gentleman.<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a>

Whilst these pages are passing through the press, George Augustus
Sala has been mercifully permitted to rest from his labours. An
unfortunate adventure with a new paper brought about serious troubles,
physical and financial, and ended his useful and hard-working life
in gloom: as Mr. Bancroft (a mutual friend) observed to the editor
of this volume, "It is so sad when the autumn of such a life is
tempestuous."--<i>December 8, 1895.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span>
was my good fortune some short time since to
revisit that most educational of English towns,
Bedford, and having many years ago
had the extreme privilege of being a
Bedford schoolboy, I was able to draw
a comparison between then and now.</p>

<p>In the good old days these admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
schools were managed in the good old
way&mdash;plenty of classics, plenty of swishing,
plenty of cricket and boating, and
plenty of holidays. We sometimes
turned out boys who afterwards made
their mark in the big world, and the
School Registers are proud to contain
the names of such men as Burnell, the
Oriental scholar, who out-knowledged
even Sir William Jones in this respect;
Colonel Fred. Burnaby, brave soldier
and attractive travel writer; Inverarity,
the lion-hunter and crack shot; Sir
Henry Hawkins, stern judge and brilliant
wit, and many others of like
degree. Nor must we forgot that John
Bunyan here learnt sufficient reading
and writing to enable him in after years
to pen his marvellous Book during his
imprisonment in Bedford Gaol, which
was then situated midway on the bridge
over the river Ouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>In that wonderful monument to the
courage and enterprise of Mr. George
Smith (kindest of friends and best of
publishers), "The National Dictionary
of Biography," the record is frequent
of men who owed their education and
perhaps best chance in the life they
afterwards made a success, to Bedford
School, but,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"Long hushed are the chords that my boyhood enchanted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1_5">As when the smooth wave by the angel was stirred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2_6">Yet still with their music is memory haunted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1_5">And oft in my dreams are their melodies heard."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But if the good old School was a
success in those bygone days, what
must be said for it now, when, under
the Napoleon-like administration of its
present chief, the school-house has been
rebuilt in its own park, upon all the
best and latest known principles of
comfort and sanitation, where a boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
can, besides going through the full
round of usual study, follow the bent
of his own peculiar taste, and find
special training, whether it be in horse-shoeing
or music, chemistry or wood-carving,
ambulance work or drawing
from the figure; whilst the beautiful
river is covered with boats, the cricket-fields
and football yards are crowded,
and the bathing stations are a constant
joy?</p>

<p>Truly the present generation of Bedford
boys are much blessed in their
surroundings; and whilst they remember
with gratitude the pious founder,
Sir William Harper, should strive to
do credit to his name and memory by
the exercise of their powers in the
battle of after-life, having received so
thorough and broad-minded a training
in the happy and receptive days of
their youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Bedford town is now one of the most
strikingly attractive in England, with
its fine river embankment, its grand
old churches, its statues erected to the
memory of the "inspired tinker," Bunyan,
and the prison philanthropist,
Howard, both of whom lived about a
mile or so from the town, the former
at Elstow, the latter at Cardington.
It was very good and heart-restoring to
revisit the hospitable old school with
its pleasant surroundings and to find, as
Robert Louis Stevenson says, that,&mdash;</p>

ventured to include some capital lines
by our evergreen and many-sided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
friend Rudolf Chambers Lehmann, he
has again added to the interest of our
Visitors' Book under the following circumstances.
Guests and home-birds
were all resting after the exhausting
idleness of an Easter holiday when they
were suddenly aroused from their day-dreams
by loud cries of "Fire!" accompanied
by the sound of horses and
chariots approaching the house at full
speed. On looking out, like Sister Anne
or a pretty page, we were able to
assuage our guests' natural alarm by
explaining that the local fire brigade
were practising upon our vile bodies
and dwelling, and if fear existed, danger
did not. On their ultimately retiring,
satisfied with their mock efforts, and
fortified by beer, our welcome guest
wrote with his usual flying pen the

The following graphic account
of the rising in
Paris in 1848 was written
by John Poole to Charles
Dickens, and was recently found amongst
the papers of Mrs. John Forster, the
widow of the well-known writer,
Dickens' friend and biographer, and
is, I think, worthy of print.</p>

<p>John Poole was a sometime celebrated
character, having written that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
evergreen play "Paul Pry," as well as
"Little Pedlington," and other humorous
works mostly now forgotten.</p>

<p>As he grew old poverty came to bear
him company, and was only prevented
from causing him actual suffering by
the usual generosity of Dickens and
other members of that charmed circle,
further aided by a small Government
grant, obtained for him by the same
faithful friend from Lord John Russell.</p>

<p>The letter is addressed to</p>

<p>CHARLES DICKENS, Esq.,</p>
<p class="margin-left-25 smcap">No. 1 Devonshire Terrace,</p>
<p class="margin-left-50"><span class="smcap">York Gate, Regent's Park</span></p>
<p class="right">LONDON,</p>

<p>and deals with the celebrated uprisal
of the French mob, when a force of
75,000 regulars and nearly 200,000
National Guards was massed round
Paris to resist it. The carnage was
terrible, some 8000 persons being killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
on both sides, and 14,000 insurgents
made prisoners.</p>

<p>It was only by General Cavaignac's
firmness and tactful management under
Lamartine's directions, that the mob was
reduced and the Republican Government
established. The general was
afterwards nearly elected President of the
French Republic, receiving 1,448,000
votes, but Prince Louis Napoleon beat
him, and, as history tells, held the reins
in various capacities for the next twenty
eventful years.</p>

<p>Poole's letter, as that of an eye-witness,
gives a remarkably clear impression
of the scene as it appeared in
his orbit. Dickens, on receiving it,
evidently sent it the round of his
friends, and it then remained in John
Forster's possession until his death.</p>

  <p class="right topspacing2">"(<span class="smcap">
    Paris</span>), <i>Saturday, 8 Jul 1848</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Dickens</span>,</p>

<p>I wrote to you through the Embassy
on the 22nd June, giving you an address for
the three last Dombeys, and enclosing a catalogue
of the ex-King's wine; and on the
16th I sent you a word in a letter to Macready.
Dombeys not yet arrived, and I shall
wait no longer to acknowledge their arrival
(as I have been doing), but at once proceed
to give you a few lines. Since the day of
my writing to you I have lived four years:
Friday (the 23rd), Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
each a year.</p>

<p>"The proceedings of the three days of
February were mere child's-play compared
with these. Never shall I forget them, for
they showed me scenes of blood and death.
Friday morning the '<i>rappel</i>' was beat&mdash;always
a disagreeable hint. Presently I heard
discharges of musketry, then they beat the
'<i>générale</i>.' My <i>concierge</i> ran into my
room, and, with a long white face, told me
the mob had erected huge barricades in the
Faubourg-Saint-Denis, and above, down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the Porte St. Denis, and that tremendous
fighting was going on there. (The Porte
St. Denis bears marks of the fray.) 'Then,
Madame Blanchard,' I said, 'as you seem to
be breaking out again, I shall take a <i>sac-de-nuit</i>,
and say adieu to you till you shall
have returned to your good behaviour.'&mdash;'But
monsieur could not get away for love
or money&mdash;the insurgents have possession of
the Chemin de Fer, and had torn up the
rails as far as St. Denis.' This was what
she had been told, so I went out to ascertain
the fact.</p>

<p>"Impossible to approach that quarter,
and difficult to turn the corner of a street
without interruption&mdash;groups of fifteen,
twenty, thirty, fifty, in blouses, dotted all
about. Towards evening matters seemed
rather more tranquil, and between six and
seven o'clock I contrived (though not easily)
to make my way to Sestels, in the Rue St.
Honoré (one of the very best of the second-rate
restaurateurs in Paris, 'which note').
The large saloon was filled with men in
uniform, National Guards chiefly, and only
two women there. I was there about an
hour, and in that time three dead bodies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
were carried past on covered litters. It was
thought the disturbances were pretty well
over, as a powerful body of troops had been
ordered down to the scene of action.</p>

<p>"At about eight o'clock I went out for
the purpose of making a visit in the Rue
d'Enghien, but found the whole width of
the Boulevard Montmartre, which, as you
know, leads to the Boulevard St. Denis,
defended by a compact body of National
Guards&mdash;impassable! Between nine and ten
o'clock three regiments of cavalry, with
cannon&mdash;a long, long procession&mdash;marched
in the direction of the scene of insurrection.
This was a comforting sight, and as such
everybody seemed to consider it, and I went
home. And this was Midsummer Eve!&mdash;Walpurgis
Night!</p>

<p>"The next day, Saturday, Midsummer Day,
I never shall forget! Sleep had been hopeless&mdash;the
night had been disturbed by the
frequent beating of the '<i>générale</i>' and the
cry '<i>Aux Armes!</i>' Every now and then I
looked up at the sky, expecting to see it red
from some direful conflagration. Day came,
and soon the firing of musketry was heard,
now from the direction of the Faubourg-Saint-Antoine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
now from the Faubourg-Saint-Marceaux.
Then came the heavy booming of
cannon&mdash;death in every echo! From twelve
till nearly one, and again after a pause, it
was dreadful. (I cannot make 'fun' of this,
like the facetious correspondent of the
<i>Morning Post</i>. Who is he? Surely he
must be an ex-reporter for the Cobourg
Play-house, with his vulgar, ill-timed play-house
quotations. I am utterly disgusted
and revolted at the tasteless levity with which
he describes scenes of blood and destruction
and death, and so treats of matters, all of
which require grave and sober handling.
And then he describes, as an eye-witness,
things which, happen though they did, I am
certain he could not have been present to see.)</p>

<p>"Well, as we were soon to be in a state
of siege, and strictly confined to home, I can
tell you nothing but what I saw here on this
very spot. One event is a remembrance for
life. In this house lived General de Bourgon,
one of what they call the 'old Africans.'
In the course of the morning General Korte
(another of them) called on him, and said,
'I dare say Cavaignac has plenty to do. I will
go and ask him if we can be of any service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to him. If we can, I will send for you, so
keep yourself in the way.' He was in Paris
'on leave,' and had no horse with him, so he
sent Blanchard (the <i>concierge</i>) to the <i>manège</i>,
which is in the next street, to inquire whether
they had a horse that would 'stand fire.'
Yes; but they would not let it go out. The
next message intimated that they must send
it, or it would be taken by force. At about
two o'clock, going out, I met, coming out of
his apartments on the second floor (I, you
know, am on the fourth), General de Bourgon,
in plain clothes, accompanied by his wife and
his sister-in-law&mdash;the latter a very beautiful
woman, somewhat in the style of Mrs. Norton.
As usual, we exchanged <i>bon-jours</i> in passing.
I went as far as the boulevard at the
end of the street. There was a strong guard
at the 'Hôtel des Affaires Étrangères,' and
there I was stopped. An officer of the
National Guard asked me whether I was
proceeding in the direction of my residence.
Answering in the negative, he said (but
with great courtesy), 'Then, sir, I advise
you to return; it is in your interest I do
so; besides' (pointing in the direction
where was heard a heavy firing), 'd'ailleurs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
monsieur, ce n'est pas aujourd'hui un jour de
promenade.'</p>

<p>"I returned, and tried by the Place Vendôme,
but about half-way up the Rue de la
Paix was again stopped. After loitering
about for an hour, and unable to get anything
in the shape of positive information,
I returned home. Shortly after three I saw
the General de Bourgon in full uniform, and
on horseback. He proceeded a few paces,
stopped to have one of his stirrup-leathers
adjusted, and then, followed by an orderly,
went off at a brisk trot. Soon afterwards a
guard was placed in the middle and at each
end of this street; no one was allowed to
loiter, or to quit it but with good reason,
and only then was passed on by one sentinel
to the next, so from that moment I was not
out of the house till Monday morning.</p>

<p>"At about half-past six the street&mdash;usually
a noisy one&mdash;being perfectly still, I heard the
measured tramp of feet approaching from
the direction of the boulevard. I went to
the window, and saw about fifteen or eighteen
soldiers, some bearing, and the rest
guarding, a litter, on which was stretched a
wounded officer. He was bare-headed, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
black stock had been removed, his coat
thrown wide open, and over his left thigh
was spread a soldier's grey greatcoat. To
my horror the procession stopped at this
door. It was the General brought home
desperately wounded! I ran down and saw
him brought up to his apartment, crying out
with agony at every shake he received on the
winding, slippery staircase. On the following
Friday (the 30th), at eleven o'clock at
noon, after severe suffering, he died. In the
course of the day I saw him; his neck was
uncovered, and the eyes open (a painter had
been making a sketch of him)&mdash;he looked
like one in placid contemplation. Previously
to the fatal result, at one of my frequent
visits of inquiry, I saw Madame de Bourgon
(the sister-in-law). She replied mournfully,
but without apparent emotion, 'We are in
hopes they will be able to perform the amputation
to-morrow.' (They could not.)
'But see! he has passed his life, as it were,
on the field of battle&mdash;twelve years in Africa&mdash;and
to fall in this way! But it was his
duty to go out.'</p>

<p>"'And, madame, how is she?'</p>

<p>"'Eh, mon Dieu, monsieur! how would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
you have her be? But a soldier's wife must
be prepared for these things.'</p>

<p>"(She, the sister-in-law, is the wife of the
general's brother, Colonel de Bourgon.)
His friend, General Korte, too, was wounded,
but not dangerously.</p>

<p>"In all the African campaigns only two
generals were killed, in these street fights
six! But the insurgents fought at tremendous
advantage. On that said Saturday
afternoon two incidents occurred, trifling if
you will, but they struck me. A large
flight of crows passed over, taking a direction
towards the prison of St. Lazare, showing
that fighting was murderous; and a
rainbow (one of the most beautiful I ever
saw) rested like an arch on the line of roof
of the opposite houses. Beneath it seemed
to come the noise of the fight; the sign of
peace and the sounds of war and death. Mrs.
Norton could make a verse or two out of
this. This was Midsummer's Day!</p>

<p>"Our Midsummer Night's dreams were
not pleasant, believe me. No&mdash;there was
no sleep on that night&mdash;a night of terrible
anxiety. Paris was in a state of siege&mdash;no
one allowed to be out of the house, nor a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
window permitted to be opened. All night
was heard in ceaseless round, from the sentinel
under my very window&mdash;'Sentinelle
prenez garde à vous.' I can hardly describe
by words the peculiar tone in which this
was uttered, but the syllable 'nelle' was
accented, and the word 'vous' was uttered
briskly and sharply, like a sort of bark.
This was given <i>fortissimo</i>&mdash;repeated by the
next <i>forte</i>&mdash;beyond him, <i>piano</i>&mdash;further on,
<i>pianissimo</i>&mdash;till it returned, louder and
louder, and then died away again, and so
on, and on, and on till daybreak. Then
was beat the '<i>rappel</i>'&mdash;then the '<i>générale</i>'&mdash;then
again the firing.</p>

<p>"This was Sunday morning, and from five
o'clock till ten at night was not the happiest,
but the longest day of my life. Any sort of
occupation was out of the question. Each
hour appeared a day. Impossible to get out,
or to receive a visit, or to send a message,
or to procure any reliable information as to
what was going on, or how or when these
doings were likely to end. All was doubt,
uncertainty, dread and anxiety intolerable.
The only information to be procured was
from the bearers of some wounded men as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
they passed now and then to the Ambulance
(the temporary hospital established at the
Church of the Assumption). But no two
accounts were alike. I was suffering deep
anxiety concerning a good kind French family
of my acquaintance, living within a five
minutes' walk of this place. 'Could I by
any possibility procure a commissionaire to
carry a note for me? I'll give him five
francs (the hire being ten sous).' 'Not,
sir,' said my <i>concierge</i>, 'if you would give
a hundred!' The poor general wanted
some soldiers from the barracks (next to the
Assumption) to carry an order for him.
After great difficulty the wife of the <i>concierge</i>
was allowed to go and fetch one; but
she was searched for ammunition by the first
sentinel, and then passed on thus and back
again from one to another. No post in&mdash;no
letters&mdash;no newspapers. At length, at a
month's end, night came. That night like
the last&mdash;'Sentinelle prenez garde à vous,'
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"On Monday morning (26th), after a
sleepless night&mdash;for, for any means we had
of knowing to the contrary, the insurgents
might at any moment be expected to attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
this quarter, a quarter marked down by
them for fire and pillage&mdash;at about eight
o'clock, I lay down on a sofa and slept
soundly till ten; I awoke, and was struck by
the appalling silence! This is a noisy street.
Always from about seven in the morning till
late in the day one's head is distracted by
the shrill cries of itinerant traders (to these
are now added the cries of the vendors of
cheap newspapers), the passage of carriages
and carts of all descriptions, street-singers,
organ-grinders endless, the screeching of
parrots and barking of dogs exposed for sale
by a <i>grocer</i> on the opposite side of the way,
together with the swarming of his and his
neighbour's dirty children&mdash;all was hushed;
not a footfall, 'not (a line that is not
often applicable here) a drum was heard.'
Yes, I repeat it, this universal silence was
appalling! Not a person, save the still
guards on duty, was to be seen. The shops
were all closed, and, but for this circumstance,
it seemed like a Sunday! Strange!
(and I find it was the same with many other
persons to whom I have mentioned the circumstance)
I was uncertain during these
anxious days as to the day of the week. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
about eleven o'clock the <i>concierge</i> came to
tell me that the insurrection was at an end.
In less than an hour there was heard a sharp
fusillade and a heavy cannonade in the direction
of the Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. The
insurgents had strengthened themselves at that
point (she came to say), but that, so far as
she could learn, General Cavaignac had at
length resolved, by bombarding the <i>quartier</i>,
to suppress the insurrection before the day
should end. <i>And he did!</i></p>

<p>"Frequently during the day parties of
tired soldiers, scarcely able to walk, passed on
their way from the scene of action to their
barracks or their bivouac; wounded men
were every now and then brought to the
Ambulance close by&mdash;one a Cuirassier, who,
as the guard saluted him, smiled faintly, and
just raised his hand in sign of recognition,
which fell again at his side; and, most striking
of all, bands of prisoners from among
the insurgents!! Among them such hideous
faces! scarcely human! No one knows
whence they come. Like the stormy petrel,
they only are seen in troubled times. I saw
some such in the days of February, but never
before, nor afterwards, till now. Imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
O. Smith, well "made-up" for one of the
bloodiest and most melodramatic of his bloody
melodramas&mdash;a Parisian dandy compared
with some of these. Some of them naked to
the waist, smeared with blood, hair and beard
matted and of incalculable growth, bloodshot
eyes, scowling ferocious brutes, their
tigers' mouths blackened with gunpowder&mdash;creatures
to look at and shudder! And
into their hands was Paris and its peaceable
honest inhabitants threatened to fall. With
this I end.</p>

the beautiful rocks of Red Head, near Arbroath,
and surrounded by the glamour of Sir Walter
Scott's "Antiquary," which was written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in the alongside village of Auchmithie,
and the plot and incidents of which are
principally placed here, stands Ethie
Castle, the Scotch home of the Earls of
Northesk, and once one of the many
residences of Cardinal Beaton, whose
portrait by Titian hangs in the hall.</p>

<p>Many of the quaint old rooms have
secret staircases at the bed-heads leading
to rooms above or below, and forming
convenient modes of escape if the
occupants of the middle chambers were
threatened with sudden attack. There
are also some dungeon-like rooms
below, with walls of vast thickness, and
"squints" through which to fire arrows
or musket-balls. The castle has been
greatly improved and partly restored
by its last owner, without removing
or destroying any of its characteristic
points.</p>

<p>Searching, when a guest there some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
years ago, amongst the literary and other
curious remains, which add a great
charm to this most interesting house,
the writer was impressed with the
following characteristic letter from
Charles II. to the then Lord Northesk,
which he was permitted to copy, and
now to print. The letter is curious, as
showing the evident belief that the
King held in his Divine right to interfere
with his subjects' affairs.</p>

<p>It is a holograph, beautifully written
in a small clear hand&mdash;-not unlike that
of W. M. Thackeray&mdash;-and has been
fastened with a seal, still unbroken, no
larger than a pea, but which nevertheless
contains the crown and complete
royal arms, and is a most beautiful
specimen of seal-engraving. It would
be interesting to know if this seal still
exists amongst the curiosities at Windsor
Castle:&mdash;-</p>

<p class="topspacing1">Looking at the fine portrait of the
recipient of this royal request, which
hangs in the castle, and the stern, unrelenting
expression of the otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
handsome face, it is not difficult to presume
that he somewhat resented this
interference with his domestic plans.
No copy of Lord Northesk's reply
exists, but its contents may be guessed
by the second letter from Whitehall,
this time written by Lord Lauderdale:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Whitehall</span>, 18 <i>Jany</i>. 1673.</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,<br />
Yesterday I received yours of the
7th instant, and, according to your desire, I
acquainted the King with it. His Majesty
commanded me to signify to you that he is
satisfied. For as he did recommend that
marriage, supposing that it was acceptable to
both parties, so he did not intend to lay any
constraint upon you. Therfor he leaves you
to dispose of your daughter as you please.
This is by His Majesty's command signified
to your Lordship by,</p>

<p class="margin-left-10">My Lord,</p>
<p class="margin-left-25">Your Lordship's most humble servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Lauderdale."</p>
<p class="smcap">Earl Northesk.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p class="topspacing1">As, however, the marriage eventually
did take place, let us hope that the
young couple arranged it themselves,
without any further expression of Royal
wishes by the evidently well-meaning,
if somewhat imperative, King.</p>

<p>Ethie has, of course, its family legends
and ghosts&mdash;what old Scotch house is
without them?&mdash;but the following,
which I am most kindly permitted to
repeat, is so curious in its modern
confirmation, that it is well worth
adding to the store of such weird
narratives.</p>

<p>Many years ago, it is said that a
lady in the castle destroyed her young
child in one of the rooms, which afterwards
bore the stigma of the association.
Eventually the room was closed,
the door screwed up, and heavy wooden
shutters were fastened outside the
windows. But those who occupied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
rooms above and below this gruesome
chamber would often hear, in the
watches of the night, the pattering of
little feet over the floor, and the sound
of the little wheels of a child's cart
being dragged to and fro; a peculiarity
connected with this sound being, that
one wheel creaked and chirruped as it
moved. Years rolled by, and the room
continued to bear its sinister character
until the late Lord Northesk succeeded
to the property, when he very wisely
determined to bring, if possible, the
legend to an end, and probe the
ghostly story to its truthful or fictitious
base.</p>

<p>Consequently he had the outside
window shutters removed, and the
heavy wall-door unscrewed, and then,
with some members of his family
present, ordered the door to be forced
back. When the room was open and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
birds began to sing, it proved to be
quite destitute of furniture or ornament.
It had a bare hearth-stone, on which
some grey ashes still rested, and by the
side of the hearth was a child's little
wooden go-cart on four solid wooden
wheels!</p>

<p>Turning to his daughter, my lord
asked her to wheel the little carriage
across the floor of the room. When
she did so, it was with a strange sense
of something uncanny that the listeners
heard one wheel creak and chirrup as
it ran!</p>

<p>Since then the baby footsteps have
ceased, and the room is once more
devoted to ordinary uses, but the
ghostly little go-cart still rests at Ethie
for the curious to see and to handle.
Many friends and neighbours yet
live who testify to having heard the
patter of the feet and the creak of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the little wheel in former days, when
the room was a haunted reality, but

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
late Cardinal Manning
always felt a great interest
in our parish of Brasted.
In former times it formed
part of Hever Chase, the property of
Sir Thomas Boleyn (the father of Queen
Anne Boleyn), who lived at Hever
Castle, about four miles from Brasted,
a fine Tudor specimen of domestic
architecture, which is now somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
jealously shown to the public on certain
days. Hever Castle is the original
of Bovor Castle, immortalised by Mr.
Burnand in his wonderful "Happy
Thoughts."</p>

<p>The Cardinal's father, who was at
one time an opulent city merchant,
and sometime Governor of the Bank of
England, owned the estate of Combe
Bank, formerly the English location of
the Argyll family, whose Duke sat in
the House of Lords, until quite a recent
date, as Baron Sundridge, the name of
the adjacent village.</p>

<p>In Sundridge Church are some family
busts of the Argylls by Mrs. Dawson
Damer, who stayed much at Combe
Bank, and who lies buried with all
her graving and sculpting tools in
Sundridge churchyard.</p>

<p>The Cardinal and his elder brother,
Charles Manning, passed some youthful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
years in this house, and when financial
trouble overtook their father, and he
was obliged to part with the property,
it became the ever-present desire and
day-dream of the elder son to succeed
in life and repurchase the place. He
succeeded well in life, and enjoyed a
very long and happy one; but he never
became the owner of Combe Bank, the
hope to do so only fading with his
life.</p>

<p>He owned, or leased, a pleasant old
house at Littlehampton; and if his
brother, the Cardinal, was in need of
rest, he would lend it to him, when
the Cardinal's method of relaxation was
to go to bed in a sea-looking room, and,
with window open, read, write, and
contemplate for some three or four days
and nights, and then arise refreshed like
a giant, and return to the manifold
duties waiting for him in town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cardinal's home in London was
formerly the Guard's Institute in the
Vauxhall Bridge Road, which, failing in
its first intention, was purchased as the
palace for the then newly-elected Cardinal-Archbishop
of Westminster. It
proved to be rather a dreary, draughty,
uncomfortable abode, but having the
advantage of a double staircase and some
large reception rooms, was useful for
the clerical assemblies he used to invoke.</p>

<p>I had the privilege, without being a
member of his church, of being allowed
to attend the meetings of the <i>Academia</i>
which the Cardinal held every now and
then during the London season. His
friends would gather in one of the big
rooms a little before eight in the evening,
and sit in darkened circles around
a small centre table, before which a
high-backed carved chair stood. The
entire light for the apartment proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
from two big silver candlesticks on the
table. As the clock chimed eight, the
Cardinal, clothed in crimson cassock and
skull-cap, would glide into the room,
and standing before the episcopal chair,
murmur a short Latin prayer, after
which the discussion of the evening
would begin; when all that wished
had had their little say, the Cardinal
replied to the points raised by the
various speakers, and closed the debate;
after which he held a sort of informal
reception, welcoming individually every
guest.</p>

<p>No one but a Rembrandt could give
the beautiful effect of the half-lights
and heavy black shadows of this striking
gathering, with its centre of colour
and light in the tall red figure of
the Cardinal, his noble face and picturesque
dress forming a mind-picture
which can never fade from the memory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The strong theatrical effect, combined
with the real simplicity of the scene,
the personal interest of many of those
who took part in the discussion, the
associations with the past, the speculation
whither the innovation of the
installation of a Roman Catholic Archbishop
in Westminster was tending,
giving the observer bountiful food for
much solemn thought.</p>

<p>Upon our book-shelves repose four
volumes of the Cardinal's sermons,
preached when a member of the Church
of England, and Archdeacon of Chichester.
They were bought at Bishop
Wilberforce's sale, who was the Cardinal's
brother-in-law, and contain the
autograph of William Wilberforce, the
bishop's eldest brother. Upon the same
shelf will be found a copy of "Parochial
Sermons" by John Henry Newman,
Vicar of St. Mary the Virgin's,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Oxford. This volume formerly belonged
to Bishop Stanley, and came
from the library of his celebrated son,
Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, sometime Dean
of Westminster.</p>

<p>A good book might be written by
one who is duly qualified on "the Poets
who are not read." It would not be
flattering to the ghosts of many of the
departed great, but there is so much
assumption on the part of the general
reader, that he knows them all, has
read them all, and generally likes them
all, which if examined into closely
would prove a snare and a delusion,
that one is tempted to administer some
gentle interrogatories upon the subject.
First and foremost, then, who now reads
Byron? His works rest on the shelves,
it is true, but are they ever opened,
except to verify a quotation? Does the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
general reader of this time steadily go
through "Childe Harold," "Don Juan,"
and his other splendid works. Not death
but sleep prevails, from which perchance
one day he may awake and again enjoy
his share of fame and favour. It is the
fashion with many persons to express
the utmost sympathy with and acute
knowledge of the work of Robert
Browning, but we doubt if many of
these could pass a Civil Service examination
in the very poems they
name so glibly. He is so hard to
understand without time and close
study, that few have the inclination to
give either in these days of pressure,
worry, and rush.</p>

<p>Upon neglected shelves Cowper and
Crabbe lie dusty and unopened&mdash;the
only person who read Crabbe in these
days was the late Edward FitzGerald;
and it is a small class apart that still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
looks up to Wordsworth. The stars of
Keats and Shelley, it is true, are just
now in the ascendant, and may so remain
for a little while.</p>

<p>It is difficult and dangerous, we are
told, to prophesy unless we know, but
our private opinion is that Lord Tennyson's
fame has been declining since his
death, and that a large portion of his
poems and all his plays will die, leaving
a living residuum of such splendid
work as "Maud," "In Memoriam,"
and some of his short poems.</p>

<p>America has furnished us with Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose charm
and finish is likely to continue its hold
upon our imagination; then there is the
Quaker poet Whittier, who will probably
only live in a song or two; and
Longfellow, whose popularity has a long
time since declined. He once wrote
a sort of novel or romance called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
"Hyperion," which showed his reading
public for the first time that he was
possessed of a gentle humour, which
does not often appear in his poems.
For instance, one of his characters, by
name Berkley, wishing to console a
jilted lover, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I was once as desperately in love
as you are now; I adored, and was
rejected.'</p>

<p>"'You are in love with certain attributes,'
said the lady.</p>

<p>"'Damn your attributes, madam,'
said I; 'I know nothing of attributes.'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said she, with dignity, 'you
have been drinking.'</p>

<p>"So we parted. She was married
afterwards to another, who knew something
about attributes, I suppose. I
have seen her once since, and only
once. She had a baby in a yellow
gown. I hate a baby in a yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
gown. How glad I am she did not
marry me."</p>

<p>The fate of most poets is to be cut
up for Dictionaries of Quotations, for
which amiable purpose they are often
admirably adapted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Staying</span>
many years ago
in a pleasant country-house,
whilst walking home after
evening church my host
remarked, as we passed in the growing
darkness a house from which streamed
a light down the path from the front
door, "Ah! Jane has not yet returned."
The phrase sounded odd, and when we
were snugly ensconced in the smoking-room,
he that evening told me the
following story, which, however, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
stopped midway, but to which I am
now able to add the sequel.</p>

<p>A certain John Manson (the name is,
of course, fictitious), an elderly wealthy
City bachelor, married late in life a
young girl of great beauty, and with
no friends or relations.</p>

<p>She found her husband's country
home, in which she was necessarily
much alone, very dull, and she thought
that he was hard and unsympathising
when he was at home; whereas, although
a curt, reserved manner gave this impression,
he was really full of love for,
and confidence in his young wife, and
inwardly chafed at and deplored his
want of power to show what his real
feelings were.</p>

<p>The misunderstanding between them
grew and widened, like the poetical
"rift within the lute," and soon after
the birth of her child, a girl, she left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
her home with her baby, merely leaving
a few lines of curt farewell, and was
henceforth lost to him. His belief in
her honesty never wavered; and night
after night, with his own hand, he
lighted and placed in a certain hall-window
a lamp which thus illuminated
the path to the door, saying, "Jane will
return, poor dear; and it's sure to be at
night, and she'll like to see the light."</p>

<p>Years passed by, and Jane made no
sign, the light each evening shining
uselessly; and still a stranger to her
home, she died, leaving her daughter,
now a beautiful girl of twenty, and
marvellously like what her mother was
when she married.</p>

<p>The husband, unaware of the death
of his wife, himself came to lay him for
the last beneath his own roof-tree, and
still his one cry was, "Jane will return."
It seemed as if he could not pass in peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
from this world's rack until it was
accomplished&mdash;when, lo! a miracle
came to pass; for the daughter arrived
one evening with a letter from her
mother, written when she was dying,
and asking her husband's forgiveness,
and the light still beamed from the
beacon window.</p>

<p>The old man was only semi-conscious,
and mistaking his child for her
mother, with a strong voice cried out,
"I knew you'd come back," and died
in the moment of the joy of her supposed
return.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence, since writing
this true story, which was told to
me in 1865, some of the incidents, in
an altered form, have found a place in
Mr. Ian Maclaren's popular book, "Beside
the Bonnie Brier Bush." It would
be interesting to know from whence
he drew his inspiration, and whether his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
story should perchance trace back to a
common ancestor in mine.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>A few years ago Mr. Walter Hamilton
published, in six volumes, the most
complete collection of English parodies
ever brought together. Amongst others,
he gave a vast number upon the well-known
poem by Charles Wolfe of "Not
a drum was heard." Page after page is
covered with them, upon every possible
subject; but the following one, written
by an "American cousin" many years
ago, and which was not accessible to Mr.
Hamilton, is perhaps worth repeating
and preserving. He called it "The
Mosquito Hunt," and it runs as follows,

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A pleasant</span>
hour may
perhaps be passed in searching
through the family
autograph-box in the book-room.
Its contents are varied and far-fetched.
A capital series of letters from
that best and most genial of correspondents,
James Payn, are there to puzzle,
by their very difficult calligraphy, the
would-be reader. Mr. Payn, a dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
friend to Foxwold, is now a great invalid,
and a brave sufferer, keeping,
despite his pain, the same bright spirit,
the same brilliant wit, and delighting
with the same enchanting conversation.
Out of all his work, there is nothing so
beautiful as his lay-sermons, published
in a small volume called "Some Private
Views;" and but a little while since
he wrote, on his invalid couch, a most
affecting study, called "The Backwater
of Life;" it has only up to the present
time appeared in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>,
but will doubtless be soon collected with
other work in a more permanent form.
It is a pathetic picture of how suffering
may be relieved by wit, wisdom, and
courage.</p>

<p>As Mr. Leslie Stephen well says in his
brother's life, "For such literature the
British public has shown a considerable
avidity ever since the days of Addison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
In spite of occasional disavowals, it
really loves a sermon, and is glad to
hear preachers who are not bound by
the proprieties of the religious pulpit.
Some essayists, like Johnson, have been
as solemn as the true clerical performer,
and some have diverged into the humorous
with Charles Lamb, or the cynical
with Hazlitt."<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a>
<a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In Mr. Payn's lay-sermons we have
the humour and the pathos, the tears
being very close to the laughter; and
they reflect in a peculiarly strong
manner the tender wit and delicate
fancy of their author.</p>

<p>But to return to our autograph-box.
Here we find letters from such varied
authors as Josef Israels, the Dutch
painter, Hubert Herkomer, W. B. Richmond,
Mrs. Carlyle, Wilkie Collins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Dean Stanley, and a host of other
interesting people. Perhaps a few extracts,
where judicious and inoffensive,
may give an interest to this especial
chat.</p>

<p>The late Mrs. Charles Fox of Trebah
was in herself, both socially and intellectually,
a very remarkable woman.
Born in the Lake Country, and belonging
to the Society of Friends, she formed,
as a girl, many happy friendships with
the Wordsworths, the Southeys, the
Coleridges, and all that charmed circle
of intellect, every scrap of whose sayings
and doings are so full of interest, and so
dearly cherished.</p>

<p>These friendships she continued to
preserve after her marriage, and when
she had exchanged her lovely lake
home for an equally beautiful and interesting
one on the Cornish coast, first
at Perran and afterwards at Trebah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>One of her special friendships was
with Hartley Coleridge, who indited
several of his sonnets to his beautiful
young friend.</p>

<p>The subjoined letter gives a pleasant
picture of his friendly correspondence,
and has not been included in the published
papers by his brother, the Rev.
Derwent Coleridge, who edited his
remains.</p>

<p>"So much for verse, which, being execrably
bad, cannot be excused, except by
friendship, therefore is the fitter for a
friendly epistle. There's logic for you! In
fact, my dear lady, I am so much delighted,
not to say flattered, by your wish that I
should write to you, that I can't help being
rather silly. It will be a sad loss to me
when your excellent mother leaves Grasmere;
and to-morrow my friend Archer and I dine
at Dale End, for our farewell. But so it
must be. I am always happy to hear anything
of your little ones, who are such very sweet
creatures that one might almost think it a
pity they should ever grow up to be big
women, and know only better than they do
now. Among all the anecdotes of childhood
that have been recorded, I never heard of
one so characteristic as Jenny-Kitty's wish
to inform Lord Dunstanville of the miseries
of the negroes. Bless its little soul! I am
truly sorry to hear that you have been suffering
bodily illness, though I know that it
cannot disturb the serenity of your mind. I
hope little Derwent did not disturb you with
his crown; I am told he is a lovely little
wretch, and you say he has eyes like mine.

enough to do.<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a>

kindness to him and his lady. I hope the
friendship of Friends will not obstruct his
rising in the Church, and that he will consult
his own interest prudently, paying court to
the powers that be, yet never so far committing
himself as to miss an opportunity
of ingratiating himself with the powers that
may be. Let him not utter, far less write,
any sentence that will not bear a twofold
interpretation! For the present let his
liberality go no further than a very liberal
explanation of the words consistency and
gratitude may carry him; let him always be
honest when it is his interest to be so, and
sometimes when it may appear not to be so;
and never be a knave under a deanery or a
rectory of five thousand a year! My best
remembrances to your husband, and kisses

following letter to the now well-known
Caroline Fox of Penjerrick will be read
with interest:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Torquay</span>, 10 <i>mo</i>. 13, 1868.</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>I hope the 'one cloud' has passed
away. I was much pleased with the earnestness
and feeling of the poem, and wished to ask
thee for a copy of it, but was afraid to give
thee the trouble of writing it out for me.</p>

<p>"For myself, I have endeavoured only to
speak when I have had something to say
which it seemed to me ought to be said, and
I did not feel that the sentiment of the poem
condemned me.</p>

<p>"We had a pleasant visit to Kynance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Cove. It is a charming place, and we were
delighted with it. We went on through
Helston to Penzance: the day following we
visited the Logan Rock and the Land's End,
and in the afternoon the celebrated Mount&mdash;the
weather all we could wish for. We were
greatly pleased with the Mount, and I shall
not read 'Lycidas' with less interest now
that I have seen the place of the 'great
vision.' We found the hotel to which you
kindly directed us perfect in all respects.
On Friday we came from Penzance to Truro,
and posted to St. Columb, where we spent a
night at Mr. Northy's&mdash;the day and night
were very wet. Next day we posted to
Tintagel, and back to Launceston, taking
the train there for Torquay.</p>

<p>"We were pressed for time at Tintagel,
but were pleased with what we saw.</p>

<p>"Here, we are in a land of beauty and of
summer, the beauty beyond my expectation,
and the climate like that of Nice. Yesterday
we drove round to see the sights, and W.
Pengelly and Mr. Vivian went with us to
Kent's Cavern, Anstey's Cove, and the round
of exquisite views. We are at Cash's Hotel,
but visit our friend Susan Midgley in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
day and evening. To-morrow we start for
Street, to stay a day or two with my daughter
Helen, and are to spend Sunday at Bath.
We have seen much and enjoyed much in
our excursion, but we shall remember nothing
with more pleasure than your kindness and
our stay at Penjerrick.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth joins me in kind and affectionate
remembrance of you, and in the hope
that thy dear father did not suffer from the
'long hours' to which my talk subjected
him. When we get back to our bleak
region and home of cold and smoke, we
shall often think of your pleasant retreat,
and of the wonderful gardens at Penjerrick.</p>

<p class="topspacing1">There are few men whose every
uttered word is regarded with greater
respect and interest than Mr. Ruskin.
It is well known that he has always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
been a wide and careful collector of
minerals, gems, and fine specimens of
the art and nature world. One of his
various agents, through whom at one
time he made many such purchases,
both for himself and his Oxford and
Sheffield museums, was Mr. Bryce
Wright, the mineralogist, and to him
are addressed the following five
letters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote topspacing1">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Brantwood, Coniston, Lancashire</span>,</p>
<p class="margin-left-60"><i>22nd May '81</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wright</span>,</p>

<p>I am very greatly obliged to you
for letting me see these opals, quite unexampled,
as you rightly say, from that locality&mdash;but
from that locality <i>I</i> never buy&mdash;my
kind is the opal formed in pores and cavities,
throughout the mass of that compact brown
jasper&mdash;this, which is merely a superficial
crust of jelly on the surface of a nasty brown
sandstone, I do not myself value in the least.
I wish you could get at some of the geology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of the two sorts, but I suppose everything
is kept close by the diggers and the Jews at
present.</p>

<p>"As for the cameos, the best of the two,
'supposed' (by whom?) to represent Isis,
represents neither Egyptian nor Oxonian
Isis, but only an ill-made French woman of
the town bathing at Boulogne, and the
other is only a 'Minerve' of the Halles,
a <i>petroleuse</i> in a mob-cap, sulphur-fire
colour.</p>

<p>"I don't depreciate what I want to buy,
as you know well, but it is not safe to send
me things in the set way 'supposed' to be
this or that! If you ever get any more nice
little cranes, or cockatoos, looking like what
they're supposed to be meant for, they shall
at least be returned with compliments.</p>

<p>"I send back the box by to-day's rail;
put down all expenses to my account, as I
am always amused and interested by a parcel
from you.</p>

<p>"You needn't print this letter as an
advertisement, unless you like!</p>

<p>The silver's safe here, and I want
to buy it for Sheffield, but the price seems to
me awful. It must always be attached to it
at the museum, and I fear great displeasure
from the public for giving you such a price.
What is there in the specimen to make it so
valuable? I have not anything like it, nor
do I recollect its like (or I shouldn't want
it), but if so rare, why does not the British

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wright</span>,</p>

<p>I am very glad of your long and
interesting letter, and can perfectly understand
all your difficulties, and have always
observed your activity and attention to your
business with much sympathy, but of late
certainly I have been frightened at your
prices, and, before I saw the golds, was rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
uneasy at having so soon to pay for them.
But you are quite right in your estimate of
the interest and value of the collection, and
I hope to be able to be of considerable
service to you yet, though I fear it cannot
be in buying specimens at seventy guineas,
unless there is something to be shown for
the money, like that great native silver!</p>

<p>"I have really not been able to examine
the red ones yet&mdash;the golds alone were more
than I could judge of till I got a quiet hour
this morning. I might possibly offer to
change some of the locally interesting ones
for a proustite, but I can't afford any more
cash just now.</p>

<p class="margin-left-25">Ever very heartily yours,</p>

<p class="topspacing2">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wright</span>,</p>

<p>My telegram will, I hope, enable
you to act with promptness about the golds,
which will be of extreme value to me; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
its short saying about the proustites will, I
hope, not be construed by you as meaning
that I will buy them also. You don't really
suppose that you are to be paid interest of
money on minerals, merely because they have
lain long in your hands.</p>

<p>"If I sold my old arm-chair, which has
got the rickets, would you expect the purchaser
to pay me forty years' interest on the
original price? Your proustite may perhaps
be as good as ever it was, but it is not worth
more to me or Sheffield because you have
had either the enjoyment or the care of it
longer than you expected!</p>

<p>"But I am really very seriously obliged by
the <i>sight</i> of it, with the others, and perhaps
may make an effort to lump some of the
new ones with the gold in an estimate of
large purchase. I think the gold, by your
description, must be a great credit to Sheffield
and to me; perhaps I mayn't be able to part
with it!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">An</span>
oval picture that hangs
opposite Sheridan's portrait
is a fine presentment of
the Marquis de Ségur, by
Vanloo.</p>

<p>The Marquis was born in 1724, and
eventually became a marshal of France,
and minister of war to Louis XVI.
After his royal master's execution he
fell into very low water, and it was only
by his calm intrepidity in very trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
circumstances that he escaped the guillotine.
His memoirs have from time
to time appeared, generally under the
authority of some of his descendants.
This interesting portrait belonged to
the family of de Ségur, and was parted
with by the present head of the house
to the late Mrs. Lyne Stephens, who
gave it to us.</p>

<p>The history of this admirable woman
is deeply interesting in every detail.
She was the daughter of Colonel Duvernay,
a member of a good old French
family, who was ruined by the French
Revolution of 1785. Born at Versailles
in the year 1812, her father had the
child named Yolande Marie Louise;
and she was educated at the Conservatoire
in Paris, where they soon discovered
her wonderful talent for dancing.
This art was encouraged, developed, and
trained to the uttermost; and when, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
due time, she appeared upon the ballet
stage, she took the town by storm, and
at once came to the foremost rank as
the well-known Mademoiselle Duvernay,
rivalling, if not excelling, the two
Ellsslers, Cerito, and Taglioni.</p>

<p>She made wide the fame of the
Cachucha dance, which was specially
rearranged for her; and the world was
immediately deluged with her portraits,
some good, some bad, many very apocryphal,
and many very indifferent.</p>

<p>In one of W. M. Thackeray's wonderful
"Roundabout Papers," which perhaps
contain some of the most beautiful
work he ever gave us, he thus recalls,
in a semi-playful, semi-pathetic tone,
his recollections of the great <i>danseuse</i>.
"In William IV.'s time, when I think
of Duvernay dancing in as the Bayadère,
I say it was a vision of loveliness such
as mortal eyes can't see nowadays.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
How well I remember the tune to
which she used to appear! Kaled used
to say to the Sultan, 'My lord, a troop
of those dancing and singing girls called
Bayadères approaches,' and to the clash
of cymbals and the thumping of my
heart, in she used to dance! There
has never been anything like it&mdash;never."</p>

<p>After a few years of brilliant successes
she retired from the stage she had done
so much to grace and dignify, and
married the late Mr. Stephens Lyne
Stephens, who in those days, and after
his good old father's death, was considered
one of the richest commoners
in England.</p>

<p>He died in 1860, after a far too short,
but intensely happy, married life; and
having no children, left his widow, as
far as was in his power, complete
mistress of his large fortune. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
were both devoted to art, and being
very acute connoisseurs, had collected a
superb quantity of the best pictures, the
rarest old French furniture, and the
finest china.</p>

<p>The bulk of these remarkable collections
was dispersed at Christie's in a
nine-days'-wonder sale in 1895, and
proved the great attraction of the season,
buyers from Paris, New York, Vienna,
and Berlin eagerly competing with
London for the best things.</p>

<p>Some of the more remarkable prices
are here noted, as being of permanent
interest to the art-loving world, and
testifying how little hard times can
affect the sale of a really fine and
genuine collection.</p>

<p>As a rule, the prices obtained were
very far in excess of those paid for the
various objects, in many cases reaching
four and five times their original cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>For thirty-four years, as a widow,
Mrs. Lyne Stephens administered, with
the utmost wisdom and the broadest
generosity, the large trust thus placed in
her most capable hands. Building and
restoring churches for both creeds (she
being Catholic and her late husband
Protestant); endowing needy young
couples whom she considered had some
claim upon her, if only as friends;
further adding to and completing her
art collections, and finishing and beautifying
her different homes in Norfolk,
Paris, and Roehampton.</p>

<p>Generous to the fullest degree, she
would warmly resent the least attempt
to impose upon her. An amusing
instance of this occurred many years
ago, when one of her husband's relations,
considering he had some extraordinary
claim upon the widow's generosity,
again and again pressed her for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
large benevolences, which for a season
he obtained. Getting tired of his importunity,
she at last declined to render
further help, and received in reply a
very abusive letter from the claimant,
which wound up by stating that if the
desired assistance were not forthcoming
by a certain date, the applicant would
set up a fruit-stall in front of her then
town-house in Piccadilly, and so shame
her into compliance with his request.
She immediately wrote him a pretty
little letter in reply, saying, "That it
was with sincere pleasure she had heard
of her correspondent's intention of pursuing
for the first time an honest calling
whereby to earn his bread, and that if
his oranges were good, she had given
orders that they should be bought for
her servants' hall!"</p>

<p>During the Franco-German war of
1870 she remained in Paris in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
beautiful home in the Faubourg-Saint-Honoré,
and would daily sally forth to
help the sufferings which the people in
Paris were undergoing. No one will
ever know the vast extent of the sacrifice
she then made. Her men-servants
had all left to fight for their country,
and she was alone in the big house,
with only two or three maids to accompany
her. During the Commune
she continued her daily walks abroad,
and was always recognised by the mob
as a good Frenchwoman, doing her
utmost for the needs of the very poor.
Her friend, the late Sir Richard Wallace,
who was also in Paris during these
troubles, well earned his baronetcy by
his care of the poor English shut up in
the city during the siege; but although
Mrs. Lyne Stephens' charity was quite
as wide and generous as his, she never
received, nor did she expect or desire it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
one word of acknowledgment or thanks
from any of the powers that were.</p>

<p>She died at Lynford, from the result
of a fall on a parquet floor, on the 2nd
September 1894, aged 82, full of physical
vigour and intellectual brightness,
and still remarkable for her personal
beauty; finding life to the last full of
many interests, but impressed by the
sadness of having outlived nearly all
her early friends and contemporaries.</p>

<p>She lingered nearly three weeks after
the actual fall, during which her affectionate
gratitude to all who watched
and tended her, her bright recognition
when faces she loved came near, her
quick response to all that was said and
done, were beautiful and touching to
see, and very sweet to remember. Her
last words to the writer of these lines
when he bade her farewell were, "My
fondest love to my beloved Julian;" our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
invalid son at Foxwold, for whom she
always evinced the deepest affection and
sympathy.</p>

<p>In her funeral sermon, preached by
Canon Scott, himself an intimate friend,
in the beautiful church she had built
for Cambridge, to a crowded and deeply
sympathetic audience, he eloquently
observed: "Greatly indeed was she
indebted to God; richly had she been
endowed with gifts of every kind; of
natural character, of special intelligence,
of winning attractiveness, which compelled
homage from all who came
under the charm of her influence;
with the result of widespread renown
and unbounded wealth.... Therefore
it was that the blessing of God came
in another form&mdash;by the discipline of
suffering and trial. There was the
trial of loneliness. Soon bereft, as she
was, of her husband, of whose affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
we may judge by the way in which he
had laid all he possessed at her feet;
French and Catholic, living amongst
those who were not of her faith or
nation, though enjoying their devoted
friendship. With advancing years, deprived
by death even of those intimate
friends, she was lonely in a sense
throughout her life.... Nor must it
be omitted that her great gift to Cambridge
was not merely an easy one out
of superfluous wealth, but that it involved
some personal sacrifice. Friends
of late had missed the sight of costly
jewels, which for years had formed a
part of her personal adornment. What
had become of a necklace of rarest
pearls, now no longer worn?&mdash;They
had been sacrificed for the erection of
this very church."</p>

<p>Again, in a Pastoral Letter by the
Roman Catholic Bishop of Northampton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to his flock, dated the 28th of
November 1894, he says: "We take
occasion of this our Advent pastoral,
to commend to your prayers the soul
of one who has recently passed away,
Mrs. Lyne Stephens. Her innumerable
works of religion and charity
during her life, force us to acknowledge
our indebtedness to her; she
built at her sole cost the churches of
Lynford, Shefford, and Cambridge, and
she gave a large donation for the church
at Wellingborough. It was she who
gave the presbytery and the endowment
of Lynford, the rectory at Cambridge,
and our own residence at Northampton.
By a large donation she greatly helped
the new episcopal income fund, and she
was generous to the Holy Father on
the occasion of his first jubilee. Our
indebtedness was increased by her bequests,
one to ourselves as the Bishop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
one for the maintenance of the fabric
of the Cambridge Church, another for
the Boy's Home at Shefford, and a
fourth to the Clergy Fund of this Diocese.
Her name has been inscribed
in our <i>Liber Vitæ</i>, among the great
benefactors whether living or dead,
and for these we constantly offer up
prayers that God may bless their good
estate in life, and after death receive
them to their reward."</p>

<p>To the inmates of Foxwold she was
for nearly a quarter of a century a true
and loving friend, paying them frequent
little visits, and entering with the deepest
sympathy into the lives of those who
also loved her very dearly.</p>

<p>The house bears, through her generosity,
many marks of her exquisite taste
and broad bounty, and her memory will
always be fragrant and beautiful to those
who knew her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three portraits of her at
Roehampton. The first, as a most winsome,
lovely girl, drawn life-size by a
great pastellist in the reign of Louis
Philippe; the second, as a handsome
matron, in the happy years of her all
too short married life; and the last, by
Carolus Duran, was painted in Paris in
1888. This has been charmingly engraved,
and represents her as a most
lovely old lady, with abundant iron-grey
hair and large violet eyes, very
wide apart. She was intellectually as
well as physically one of the strongest
women, and she never had a day's illness,
until her fatal accident, in her life.
Her conversation and power of repartee
was extremely clever and brilliant. A
shrewd observer of character, she rarely
made a mistake in her first estimate of
people, and her sometimes adverse judgments,
which at first sight appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
harsh, were invariably justified by the
history of after-events.</p>

<p>Her charity was illimitable, and was
always, as far as possible, concealed.
A simple-lived, brave, warm-hearted,
generous woman, her death has created
a peculiar void, which will not in our
time be again filled:&mdash;</p>
